# Geo-Locating Users


## Introduction
Sometimes you need the geo-location of visitors. For example, you may need to collect VAT when selling products online to European customers. In this case, geo-locating is helpful to ensure the requesting user is actually located in a EU country.

We created a Supercharge-compatible plugin called [hapi-geo-locate](https://github.com/fs-opensource/hapi-geo-locate) which makes it convenient to geo-locate users.

Find more details on how to [install and use the plugin in the GitHub repository’s README](https://github.com/futurestudio/hapi-geo-locate).
